This directory contains the fully compiled, preprocessed behavioral data (`behavioral_data_sustained.csv` and `behavioral_data_variable.csv`) and gaze data (`gaze_data_sustained.csv` and `gaze_data_variable.csv`) from all participants in each experiment, as outputted by the data compilation code in `../data_analysis_code`. Specifically, the compiled behavioral data is generated by `../data_analysis_codecompile_behavioral_data.ipynb` and the compiled gaze data is generated by `../data_analysis_code/compile_gaze_data_sustained.ipynb` and  `../data_analysis_code/compile_gaze_data_variable.ipynb`.

In all data files, each row represents a single trial from the experiment (either a presentation or a memory trial). They are in temporal order, with earlier trials at the top and later trials at the bottom. Each row contains all of the pertinent information from that trial (which stimuli were displayed, stimulus onset times, key press responses made by the participant, etc.). 

This data is read in by `analyze_behavioral_data.ipynb` and `analyze_gaze_data.ipynb` in the `../data_analysis_code` directory, and used to generate all statistical analyses and figures in our manuscript.
