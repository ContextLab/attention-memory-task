# Running the task

After full installation, running the task is simple!

To run a behavioral participant, simply open attention_memory.py in Psychopy, hit the green "run" button in the code viewer, and enter the subejct ID and run# (always enter 0 unless you have a very specific reason to desire fewer than the total number of runs indicated in params dictionary, without changing params itself; this is NOT recommended). To incorpoorate eye tracking, simply set up your eye tracker to record timestamps using your machines unciversal clock, then use our simple code to match your eye track timestamps to salient points in the experiment. Note that your code is designed for use with the EyeTribe developer kit, but all lines that would require changing to accommodate other systems are commented as such.

For fMRI....
