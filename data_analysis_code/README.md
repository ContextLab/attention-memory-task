To start exploring the behavioral data from the experiments, you will first want to run the code in the `compile_behavioral_data` notebook. This code organizes and compiles the raw behavioral data from all of the participants in each experiment. It outputs a single dataframe containing all of that experiment's data into the `../parsed_data` directory. Then, you can run the code in `analyze_behavioral_data` to generate statistics on participants' memory for attended and unattended images. This notebook also generates the violin plot (Figure 2) and timecourse figures (Figures 4, 5, and 6) from our manuscript. <br />

Run the code in the `compile_gaze_data_exp1` notebook to organize and compile the raw gaze data from experiment 1. <br />

Run the code in the `compile_gaze_data_exp2` notebook to organize and compile the raw gaze data from experiment 2. <br />

Run the code in the `analyze_behavioral_data` notebook to generate the statistics and figures (Figures 2, 4, 5, and 6) for the behavioral response data.<br />

Run the code in the `analyze_gaze_data` notebook to generate the statistics and figure (Figure 3) incorporating participants' gaze data. <br />
